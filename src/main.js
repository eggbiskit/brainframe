/* POINT BREAKDOWN + JUSTIFICATION
1. Implement a simultaneous two-player mode (30)
  - player 1 uses keys A and D to move, F to fire
  - player 2 uses left and right arrows keys to move, up arrow key to fire
  - scores are on left and right sides for p1 and p2 respectively

2. Redesign the game's artwork, UI, and sound to change 
   its theme/aesthetic (to something other than sci-fi) (60)
  - play as brain cells to destroy negative thoughts
  - ui is on theme - new menu scenes, new borders, new info scenes, new game over scene
  - sound effects + music are cute n simple

3. Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen (10)
  - time is in the middle of the screen
  - 45 sec for expert, 60 sec for n00b

TOTAL: 30 + 60 + 10 = 100
